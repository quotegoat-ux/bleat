**You own what lands. Verify each PR independently, land only the verified run from the root, then keep your hands off the queue.**

This is the half after `playbooks/babysit.md`.

1. **Verify every PR independently before arming anything.** One subagent per PR, not batched, each in its own worktree, each exercising the real surface (the `verify` skill for UIs, `run` for CLIs and TUIs, as the change demands) against parent versus head. Each returns `PASS`, `PASS+NOTES` or `FAIL` and posts that verdict on its own PR. Safe means a verdict from an agent that did not write the code. CI green is not a verdict, and an approving bot review is not a verdict.
2. **Land only the contiguous verified run rooted at the bottom.** Walk up from the lowest unmerged PR and stop at the first one without a passing verdict, where both `PASS` and `PASS+NOTES` pass. A verified PR sitting above an unverified one is not landable. Report the ceiling as a PR number and say what breaks the chain.
3. **Re-check that each verdict still describes the patch.** Record the verdict head SHA, base SHA, and stable `git patch-id` of that PR's base-to-head diff. A restack, rebase, or base retarget rewrites SHAs and can silently invalidate a verdict without touching a check. Before landing a PR, compare the recorded patch-id with its current base-to-head patch-id. Re-verify when the patch changed. When it did not, keep the code verdict but re-run mergeability and CI at the current head. Never use matching commit messages or a green check from an older SHA as a substitute.
4. **Arm merge-when-ready through Graphite, and pass `--always`.** A no-op submit skips the Graphite update and silently arms nothing, which reads exactly like success.
   ```bash
   gt submit --merge-when-ready --always --update-only --no-interactive
   ```
5. **Never enable GitHub auto-merge on a stack.** Only the root targets protected trunk. Every child targets its unprotected parent branch and already reads `CLEAN`, so GitHub would merge children into parents immediately and collapse the stack into itself. If a previous agent armed it, disarm with `gh pr merge <n> --disable-auto` and confirm the field is back off.
6. **Do not read `autoMergeRequest` as proof that MWR is armed.** It stays off until Graphite reaches that PR at the queue front, so an unarmed reading is meaningless and acting on it leads to re-submitting branches that were already fine. Confirm arming from Graphite's own state, and if you cannot, say so rather than inferring it.
7. **Once the queue is draining, stop touching the stack.** No `gt sync`, no restack, no speculative pushes, and no `gt submit --stack`, which reaches downstack into PRs that are mid-merge. Even a plain `gt submit` can retarget a base if local Graphite tracking has diverged, so never run `gt` from a worktree whose parentage you have not just checked. Independent work gets re-parented onto trunk and shipped on its own.
8. **Watch the drain, do not drive it.** Arm the watcher in queued mode over the verified run and hold it under `/loop` in dynamic mode, re-armed after any verdict you act on, until COMPLETE at the ceiling. ADVANCE is progress, not termination. Bases retarget and `graphite-base/*` refs get cut as each PR merges; that is Graphite working, not damage. Report each merge and the new ceiling. If the queue stalls, diagnose before mutating.
9. **Stop at the ceiling.** When the verified run is merged, report what landed, what the next unverified PR is, and what verifying it would take. Extending the run is a new pass through step 1.

**Reply:** the verified run and its ceiling, each PR's verdict and who produced it, what you armed and how you confirmed it, what landed, and what the next gap needs.
