# bleat

Quote Goat's agent-workflow toolkit for Claude Code, Codex, and Prime Agent. Start it with `/just-bleat-it`; leave with `/bleat-off`. A fork of [michael-denyer/pstack-claude](https://github.com/michael-denyer/pstack-claude), the Claude Code port of [poteto](https://x.com/poteto)'s [pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack) plugin (skill tree synced against upstream `4612556`, pstack v0.14.2 — see [What's deliberately not ported](#whats-deliberately-not-ported)). The same `skills/` tree also ships as a Codex plugin (see [Running on Codex](#running-on-codex)) and is discovered as-is by [Prime Agent](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent) (see [Prime Agent](#prime-agent)). Original by Lauren Tan; ships MIT. Imports seven skills from [cursor-team-kit](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/cursor-team-kit) (also MIT): `deslop`, `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review`, `make-pr-easy-to-review`, `fix-ci`, `fix-merge-conflicts`, `get-pr-comments`, `what-did-i-get-done`.

> if you want to go fast, go deep first. bleat helps you write less, but higher quality code. rigorous agent workflows you can parallelize with confidence.

This is not a verbatim copy. Skill bodies have been edited so every Cursor-specific primitive resolves to its Claude Code equivalent — see [Differences from upstream](#differences-from-upstream) for the full list. The exhaustive per-skill audit lives in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md); license attribution and the upstream pins live in [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md) and `tools/upstream.json`.

## Install

### Claude Code

This repo ships as a Claude Code marketplace containing one plugin (`bleat`).

```shell
/plugin marketplace add quotegoat-ux/bleat
/plugin install bleat@bleat
```

From 0.9.5 the plugin auto-fires, the same way superpowers does: a `SessionStart` hook (on `startup`, `/clear`, and post-`compact`) injects a ~0.3k-token mandate that routes any non-trivial engineering task into `just-bleat-it` before the first response. The full skill still loads only on invoke. Dispatched subagents are told to ignore the mandate, and explicit user instructions take precedence. To opt out, delete `hooks/hooks.json` from the installed copy (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/bleat/bleat/<version>/hooks/hooks.json`); a plugin update restores it.

### Codex

The same plugin carries a `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and a root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`. The verified install is to link the plugin's skills into your cross-runtime skills directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/quotegoat-ux/bleat
cd bleat
for s in plugins/bleat/skills/*/; do ln -s "$PWD/$s" ~/.agents/skills/"$(basename "$s")"; done
```

Codex discovers the linked skills and namespaces them under the plugin, so they list as `bleat:just-bleat-it`, `bleat:tdd`, and so on. The namespace comes from `plugins/bleat/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and resolves through the flat symlinks, even though each linked skill sits one directory below that manifest (verified on a live session via this symlink install). To enable the multi-model and parallel-subagent skills (`interrogate`, `arena`, `how`, `why`, `reflect`, `architect`), turn on subagents in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
multi_agent = true
```

For slash-command shortcuts (`/just-bleat-it`, `/tdd`, and the rest), link the command files into Codex's prompts directory:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/.codex/prompts
for c in plugins/bleat/.codex-plugin/prompts/*.md; do ln -s "$PWD/$c" ~/.codex/prompts/"$(basename "$c")"; done
```

Each command invokes its skill, so `/tdd` runs the `tdd` skill. Installing the full plugin through the Codex marketplace (the root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`) carries skills and commands together; the two symlink steps above are the verified local path. Teardown is `rm ~/.agents/skills/<name>` and `rm ~/.codex/prompts/<name>.md`.

### Prime Agent

[Prime Agent](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent) discovers skills from `~/.agents/skills/` and from `.agents/skills/` in the working tree up to the git root ([docs](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/docs/skills.md)). That is the same `~/.agents/skills/` directory the Codex install symlinks into, so the [Codex skill-link step](#codex) doubles as the Prime install — if you have already run it, Prime picks the skills up with no extra work:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/quotegoat-ux/bleat
cd bleat
for s in plugins/bleat/skills/*/; do ln -s "$PWD/$s" ~/.agents/skills/"$(basename "$s")"; done
```

bleat's `SKILL.md` frontmatter is a subset of what Prime reads: it requires `name` (lowercase, matching the parent directory — every bleat skill already conforms) and `description`, honours `disable-model-invocation`, and ignores unknown keys such as bleat's `user-invocable`. `curl -fsSL https://app.primeintellect.ai/prime-agent/install.sh | sh` installs Prime itself; `--no-skills` disables discovery, and explicit `--skill <path>` still loads. Prime is model-agnostic, so running these skills against **ChatGPT / OpenAI models is a Prime backend setting, not a plugin change** — keep the multi-model panels in `arena`, `interrogate`, `architect`, and `how` genuinely diverse across whatever models you configure (see the OpenAI panel note under [Running on Codex](#running-on-codex)).

Unverified relative to Codex: the Codex path above is confirmed on a live session; the Prime path is derived from Prime's documented discovery paths and frontmatter schema, not yet run on a live Prime session. Prime has no plugin-hook runtime, so the Claude Code auto-fire hook does not apply — enter `bleat:just-bleat-it` by name or add a standing routing instruction to your Prime config. Teardown is `rm ~/.agents/skills/<name>`.

Plugin-internal path references in the docs below (`skills/<name>/`, `.codex-plugin/prompts/<name>.md`) are relative to `plugins/bleat/`.

## Running on Codex

The Codex build shares one `skills/` tree with the Claude Code build. Nothing is forked; the only generated files are the prompt stubs, which `tools/generate.mjs` stamps from each skill's `menu-description` frontmatter. One mapping file does the translation. That single-mapping-file spine is the one `superpowers` ships for Codex. bleat diverges in one respect. superpowers writes its skills in tool-neutral language, so no skill names a runtime tool. bleat keeps the upstream Claude-native prose and adds a one-line Platform note to each skill that names a Claude primitive, so the port stays in lockstep with upstream sync.

- **Skill invocation.** Codex loads `SKILL.md` natively. There is no `Skill` tool. You invoke a skill by name (ask for it, or pick `bleat:just-bleat-it` from the list).
- **Commands.** The 31 `.codex-plugin/prompts/*.md` files are Codex-only, generated by `tools/generate.mjs` from each public skill's `menu-description` frontmatter (edit the skill, rerun the generator; hand edits to a stub are overwritten). Codex reads their `description` frontmatter and the filename, ignores the keys it doesn't know, and each body invokes its skill. Link them into `~/.codex/prompts/` for `/name` shortcuts (see [Install on Codex](#codex)). Claude Code ships no `commands/` directory: it renders both commands and user-invocable skills in the slash menu, so a trampoline paired with its skill duplicated every `/bleat:<name>` row (see CHANGES 0.9.13). The skill alone serves the slash command there.
- **Tool, model, and built-in mapping.** When a skill names a Claude tool (the `Agent` tool, `AskUserQuestion`), a `claude-*` model slug, or a Claude built-in skill (`run`, `verify`, `loop`, `plugin-dev:skill-development`), it resolves through [`skills/just-bleat-it/references/codex-tools.md`](plugins/bleat/skills/just-bleat-it/references/codex-tools.md). `just-bleat-it` and every skill that names one of those carries a one-line **Platform note** pointing there.
- **Subagents.** The `Agent` tool maps to Codex `spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `close_agent`, enabled by `multi_agent = true`. Parallel fan-out is multiple `spawn_agent` calls in one turn. Without the flag, `interrogate`, `arena`, `how`, `why`, `reflect`, and `architect` degrade to a single sequential pass. There is no `bleat-agent` subagent type on Codex; route ad-hoc subagents by dispatching a `spawn_agent` told to read `just-bleat-it` first.
- **Auto-fire.** The `hooks/` SessionStart injection is Claude Code-only; Codex has no plugin hook runtime. Enter `bleat:just-bleat-it` by name, or add a standing instruction to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` if you want the same always-on routing.
- **Models.** The `claude-*` slugs in skills are Claude defaults, stamped into each skill's Models section from `plugins/bleat/models.json`. On Codex substitute your configured Codex models, keeping multi-model panels genuinely diverse. `/setup-bleat` writes `~/.codex/bleat-models.md` (referenced from `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`) with Codex slugs instead of `~/.claude/bleat-models.md`.

Verified on a live Codex session installed via the symlinks: the user-facing skills are discovered and namespaced under `bleat` (`bleat:just-bleat-it`, `bleat:interrogate`, and so on). The `principle-*` leaf skills carry `user-invocable: false` and no command, so Codex does not surface them in the picker, the same as Claude Code. They stay installed for `just-bleat-it` to read by path. The deeper behaviors (mapping resolution mid-task, `spawn_agent` fan-out) follow the proven `superpowers` pattern and are worth confirming in your own session.

## CI

Two workflows run on every pull request and push to `main`.

`ci.yml` runs four jobs: the static plugin invariants (`tests/skill-collision-repro.sh` under `SKIP_BEHAVIORAL=1`, since the behavioral leg needs the `claude` CLI and API access), a generated-files check (`bun tools/generate.mjs` followed by `git diff --exit-code`, so a `VERSION` bump that skips regeneration or the `CHANGES.md` entry fails the build), the vendored bun tooling (`bun install --frozen-lockfile`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun test orch watch-pr`), and `shellcheck` over every shell script, selected by `.sh` extension or by shebang so the extensionless hook scripts are covered.

`security.yml` runs `osv-scanner` against the lockfiles and fails the build if no lockfile was found, because an empty scan reads exactly like a clean one. It also rejects any action reference not pinned to a full 40-character commit SHA. It runs weekly on top of the per-PR trigger, so a CVE published after a merge still surfaces. `zizmor` audits the workflows themselves for template injection, over-broad permissions, and credential persistence.

Dependabot keeps the pinned SHAs and the bun dependencies current, on a 7-day cooldown so a compromised release has time to be reported before a PR opens. Because Dependabot cannot regenerate `bun.lock`, `dependabot-lockfile.yml` does it for its PRs and pushes the result back to the branch.

Before a release, run the full `tests/skill-collision-repro.sh` locally (without `SKIP_BEHAVIORAL`) to exercise the behavioral leg CI cannot.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the sync boundary, the local checks to run, and the release rules.

## Dependencies

Nothing is declared in `plugin.json`. Install the one companion plugin yourself:

- **`plugin-dev`** (from the `claude-plugins-official` marketplace) — the rewiring routes skill-authoring tasks (in `automate-me`, `reflect`, `just-bleat-it`) to the `plugin-dev:skill-development` skill:

  ```shell
  /plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-official
  /plugin install plugin-dev@claude-plugins-official
  ```

  Until 0.9.2 this was a `dependencies` entry in `plugin.json`. The desktop app's `--plugin-dir` load mode can never resolve cross-marketplace dependencies and hard-disables the whole plugin, so 0.9.3 removed the declaration — full mechanism in the 0.9.3 entry of [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md). Without `plugin-dev` installed, only the skill-authoring routes degrade; everything else works.

Not declared as deps, but referenced in skill bodies:

- **`run`, `verify`, `loop`** — Claude Code CLI built-ins (ship with the binary, always available).
- **`gh` CLI** — system-level requirement of the `babysit` skill and the Babysit / Shipping playbooks. Install via [`brew install gh`](https://cli.github.com) and authenticate with `gh auth login`.
- **`bun`** — runs the vendored `skills/just-bleat-it/scripts/` tooling (`watch-pr`, `orch`). Install via [`brew install oven-sh/bun/bun`](https://bun.sh). Only the playbooks that call those scripts need it; `bootstrap.ts` installs the script dependencies on first run.
- **`gt` (Graphite CLI)** — only for the stack playbooks (Shipping, Orchestrate, the autopilots). Everything else works without it.
- **`jq` and `rg` (ripgrep)** — only for `scripts/worktree-audit.sh` (the Worktree cleanup playbook). Without them the audit still runs but blanks its PR and LAST_CHAT columns, so it warns on stderr rather than returning a table that looks complete.

No third-party plugins. The harsher-critique escape hatch lives in the bundled `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` skill (imported from cursor-team-kit), not in an external plugin.

## Subagents

`bleat-agent` ships unchanged. Spawn from a parent with `subagent_type: "bleat-agent"`.

`comment-sicko` is the read-only comment reviewer the `no-comments` skill spawns. Upstream names it `Comment Sicko`; the port renames it to `comment-sicko` so the name is a valid `subagent_type`. Invoke it through `/no-comments`, not directly.

## Differences from upstream

The port is editorial, not mechanical. Anywhere upstream bleat assumed Cursor-specific primitives, this port substitutes the Claude Code equivalent so refs actually resolve. Two prior ports ([v1truv1us/ai-eng-system](https://github.com/v1truv1us/ai-eng-system), [Evan-Kim2028/agent-fleet](https://github.com/Evan-Kim2028/agent-fleet)) stop at namespacing — they vendor bleat under `bleat/` and leave the Cursor refs intact. This port does the content surgery.

### What's added

- **`skills/babysit/`** — Claude Code analog of Cursor's closed-source `/babysit` built-in. Wraps `gh pr view` / `gh pr checks` / `gh run view --log-failed` plus the `loop` skill for pacing. Independently authored; workflow informed by Cursor's public `/babysit` behavior — not a copy of Cursor's implementation. Since the v0.14.2 sync, just-bleat-it routes PR-status requests to the ported `playbooks/babysit.md` instead, and this skill is the standalone `/babysit` entry point.
- **`skills/deslop/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Cleans AI tells out of diffs before commit.
- **`skills/thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Used as the harsher-critique escape hatch in `arena`, `interrogate`, `architect`, and `how` (replaces the Cursor-original cross-vendor bridge).
- **`skills/make-pr-easy-to-review/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Composes with `opening-a-pr` and `babysit`.
- **`skills/fix-ci/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Narrower CI-fix primitive that `babysit` can route to.
- **`skills/fix-merge-conflicts/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Pairs with `babysit` step 5.
- **`skills/get-pr-comments/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Primitive for `babysit` step 4 and `reflect`.
- **`skills/what-did-i-get-done/`** — imported verbatim from `cursor-team-kit`. Commit summary over a chosen period.

### What's substituted in skill bodies

| Upstream (Cursor) | This port (Claude Code) |
| --- | --- |
| `Task` tool, `subagent_type: generalPurpose`, `readonly: false/true` | `Agent` tool, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, no readonly flag (subagent_type controls MCP access) |
| `AskQuestion` tool | `AskUserQuestion` tool |
| Cursor's built-in `/loop` | Claude Code's built-in `loop` skill |
| Cursor's built-in `/babysit` | `babysit` skill bundled in this plugin. From v0.14.0 upstream routes PR-status requests inside just-bleat-it to `playbooks/babysit.md` instead; the port does the same, and `/babysit` stays the standalone entry point |
| Cursor's built-in `/create-skill` | `plugin-dev:skill-development` skill |
| `cursor-team-kit` `control-cli` (CLI/TUI driver) | Claude Code's `run` skill |
| `cursor-team-kit` `control-ui` (browser/Electron driver) | Claude Code's `verify` skill |
| Transcripts at `~/.cursor/projects/*/` or `agent-transcripts/` | `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl` (where `<encoded-cwd>` is the workspace cwd with `/` → `-`) |
| Skill paths `.cursor/skills/`, `~/.cursor/plugins/` | `.claude/skills/`, `~/.claude/plugins/` |
| MCP discovery via Cursor's `mcps/` directory | Tool list at top of system prompt (`mcp__<server>__<name>` entries), or `.mcp.json`, or `claude mcp list` |
| Cursor cloud agents (`environment: "cloud"`, `cloud_base_branch`) | Local background subagents (`run_in_background: true`), isolated by git worktree |
| Cursor's `/goal` (standing objective across turns) | The program objective written into the run's standing orders and restated in the todolist |
| The Cursor agent store (path in the system prompt) | `~/.claude/orchestrate/<project-slug>/`, which survives the session restarts a multi-day program expects |
| Model rule `~/.cursor/rules/bleat-models.mdc` | Override sheet `~/.claude/bleat-models.md`, included from `CLAUDE.md` |
| Model `composer-2.5-fast` (Cursor) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| Model `claude-opus-4-X-thinking-xhigh` (Cursor UI variant) | `claude-opus-5` (extended thinking configured separately) |
| Models `gpt-5.3-codex-high-fast`, `gpt-5.5-high-fast` (via Cursor) | `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5` (Claude family) |
| Multi-model panels (arena, architect, interrogate, how-critics) | Default panel is `claude-opus-5` + `claude-fable-5` + `claude-sonnet-5` — three distinct models across three tiers (replaces the cross-vendor diversity lost in translation). |

### What's lost in translation

**Cross-vendor model diversity.** `arena`, `interrogate`, `architect`, and `how` all rely on stress-testing a design against several *different* model families. Claude Code is single-vendor, so the split collapses to three Claude variants by tier. Instead of bridging to an external CLI for that diversity, the rewiring routes the "harsher pass" to the bundled `thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review` skill — different style of pressure (strict maintainability rubric), not vendor diversity, but it lives in-plugin with no extra installs.

### What's deliberately kept

- The `bleat-agent` subagent ID and all references to it.
- `run_in_background: true` on Agent calls (Claude Code supports it).
- `/loop`, `/deslop`, `/babysit` slash references in skill bodies — they all resolve in Claude Code now.
- The principle/playbook structure and every word of the principles themselves.

### What's deliberately not ported

- **`automations/benny/`** (upstream `0452e08`, the only bleat change between `e46364b` and v0.10.0) — a dormant Slack issue-triage and reproduce-and-fix automation pack built on Cursor's event-triggered automations. It registers no slash skills even upstream, so excluding it changes nothing about the ported plugin's behavior. Porting it would mean translating Cursor's event-trigger runtime to Claude Code's polling-based scheduled agents plus Slack and tracker plumbing — speculative infrastructure with no local user. Revisit if an unattended issue-intake stream materialises; the likely first step is porting the triage skill onto a single Claude scheduled agent, not the whole pack.
- **`docs/guide/`** (upstream `02c03a9`, `0b7ef5b`, `424829e`) — the ten-chapter usage tutorial and its six screenshots (2.3 MB). It teaches bleat through Cursor's UI, sticky mode, and cloud agents, so a faithful port would be a rewrite rather than a sync, and none of it ships as skill content. Read it upstream at [cursor/plugins/pstack/docs/guide](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack/docs/guide); the concepts map through the substitution table above. Revisit if the port grows its own tutorial.
- **Sticky mode** (upstream `#144`) — Cursor-only `mode`/`icon`/`color`/`reminder` frontmatter with no Claude Code equivalent. The port's 0.9.5 SessionStart hook is the analog and already carries the non-trivial / trivial / opt-out logic.
- **`is_background: true` on `bleat-agent`** (upstream `99559f2`) — Cursor subagent frontmatter. Claude Code's agent frontmatter has no such key, and `run_in_background: true` on the spawning `Agent` call already covers it.
- **`cursor-team-kit` beyond the seven imported skills** — the rest either duplicate Claude Code built-ins (`verify-this` → the `verify` skill and built-in verification discipline; `check-compiler-errors` → LSP diagnostics; `control-cli`/`control-ui` → `run`/`verify`, already the substitution targets) or overlap skills this port ships (`loop-on-ci`, `review-and-ship`, `weekly-review` vs `babysit`, `fix-ci`, `make-pr-easy-to-review`, `what-did-i-get-done`). `pr-review-canvas` is Cursor-UI-specific.

### Forking note

Editing skill bodies forks this from upstream. Re-syncing to a future bleat release means re-applying the substitution table. The full re-port recipe is in [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).
