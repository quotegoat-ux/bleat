# Regression checks for the bleat plugin layout (CHANGES 0.9.7-0.9.13).
#
# Claude Code renders a plugin's commands AND its user-invocable skills in the
# slash menu, so a command trampoline paired with a same-named skill shows the
# entry twice (#22). 0.9.13 moved the trampolines to .codex-plugin/prompts/,
# where only the Codex symlink path reads them. The invariant here keeps a
# future upstream sync from reintroducing plugins/bleat/commands/.
#
# This also enforces the static maintenance invariants from CHANGES.md: the
# principle-* leaf flags. The static checks need no CLI; only the behavioral
# leg below does. (Version parity, the model quad, and prompt<->skill
# correspondence are no longer checked here: tools/generate.mjs stamps each
# from its source file and CI regenerates and diffs, so none can drift on a
# green build.)
#
# Each static check is a function that prints one finding per line; empty
# output is a pass. `check` names it in the report. tests/invariants.test.mjs
# runs this script against fixture trees (via PSTACK_REPO) to prove every
# check still fails when it should.
#
# Manual test: the behavioral leg needs the claude CLI and API access; one haiku call.
